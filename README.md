# HTML & CSS - Foundation Framework Crash Course

### About

In this project we take a deep look into Zurb's Foundation CSS Framework. Similar to Twitter Bootstrap, this out-of-the-box CSS framework can help speed up productivity with tons of already-made UI classes to get your projects online faster. We cover all of the basic, everyday, tools you'll need to get up and running in no time with Foundation CSS.
